#question 1
# A double-blind clinical trial of a new drug for back pain was designed using control and treatment
# groups. Volunteers were fully informed and assigned at random to each group. Neither the volunteers
# nor the doctor knew when the new drug or a placebo was being administered. When 100 volunteers
# in each group had been treated and evaluated, the results revealed an 85% success rate for the new
# drug and a 65% success rate for the control group. At the 95% confidence level, is there a statistically
# significant difference between the two reported rates? Use a one-sided test. Also, report a confidence
# interval for the difference.

#question 2
# Two baseball players had their career records compared. In 267 times at bat, one player hit 85 home
# runs. In 248 times at bat, the other player hit 89 home runs. Assume the number of home runs follows
# a binomial distribution, is there a statistically significant difference with 95% confidence between the
# home run averages for these two baseball players?

#question 3
# Using the home_prices.csv data (described in Lesson 1), compare mean selling prices between homes
# located in the northeast sector of the city versus the remaining homes. Also, compare the mean selling

#question 4
# The nsalary.csv data are derived from data collected by the Department of Social Services of the State
# of New Mexico. The data have been adapted for this problem. Using these data compare mean salary

# methods. Report your results using a confidence interval.
